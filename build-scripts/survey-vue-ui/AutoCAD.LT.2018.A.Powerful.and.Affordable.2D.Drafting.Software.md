Some of the key features of AutoCAD LT 2018 are:
 
- **Views and Viewports:** You can now easily create, retrieve, and place model views together with automatically sized and scaled layout viewports onto the current layout[^2^]. This helps you to organize your drawings and present them in a clear and professional way.
- **PDF Import:** You can now import geometry, TrueType text, and raster images from a PDF file or underlay into the current drawing as AutoCAD objects[^2^]. This allows you to reuse existing data and save time and effort.
- **High Resolution Monitor Support:** AutoCAD LT 2018 supports high resolution monitors and displays. You can enjoy an improved visual experience with crisp icons, dialog boxes, and toolbars[^2^]. You can also adjust the size of the user interface elements to suit your preferences.
- **External Reference Path Enhancements:** You can now easily change the paths of external references (Xrefs) using the new Find and Replace option in the External References palette[^2^]. You can also convert full paths to relative paths or vice versa with a single click.
- **Object Selection:** You can now select objects that are off-screen (even when selecting within a solid hatch or gradient fill) by pressing and holding the Shift key while selecting[^2^]. You can also select objects with linetypes even when selecting the gaps[^2^].
